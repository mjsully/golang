# golang
A repo to hold some golang code while I'm learning!
## Development environment
To run the development environment, run the `run.sh` script. This launches the `golang` container, mounting the `./data/` directory at `/go/data/`, and passing port `8080` from host to the container. Install the official `golang` extension into VSCode to get autocompletion, syntax highlighting etc.
